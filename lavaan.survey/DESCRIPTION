Description: Fit structural equation models (SEM) including factor analysis,
    multivariate regression models with latent variables and many other latent
    variable models while correcting estimates, standard errors, and
    chi-square-derived fit measures for a complex sampling design. 
    Incorporate clustering, stratification, sampling weights, and 
    finite population corrections into a SEM analysis.
